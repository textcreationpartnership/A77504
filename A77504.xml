            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

When God had cauſed the <hi>braſen ſerpent</hi> to be ſet up in the wilderneſſe, ſuch as were ſtung with thoſe fiery ſerpents, (I ſuppoſe) they ſhould not need to have been preſſed to go out of their Tents, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire and look up unto it for cure. Such is our
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:169495:26"/> condition (as you have heard,) All ſtung, and that mortally by this old Serpent: And ſuch hath Gods mercy been, he hath provided a <hi>braſen ſerpent</hi> for us, cauſed his <hi>Son</hi> to bee lift up for us: O let us not now <hi>neglect ſo great ſalvation,</hi> but come forth of our <hi>Tents,</hi> go we out of <hi>our ſelves,</hi> and come unto <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> looking up to him that we may bee made partakers of the benefits of his death and paſſion. To this end was the <hi>braſen ſerpent</hi> lift up, that the people might look up to it. And to this end was the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> lift up upon the Croſſe, that poor ſinners might look unto him. And this let us do.</p>
                     <p>I mean, as many of us as <hi>feel the need wee have of him:</hi> as feele the <hi>ſting of ſin</hi> ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our ſouls, and ſo deſire to be freed not onely from the guilt and terrour, but alſo from the power of it. For ſuch and onely ſuch they are that ſhall have benefit by Chriſt. The <hi>braſen ſerpent</hi> being lift up, all <hi>Iſrael</hi> might look upon it, but they only had benefit by it, who feeling themſelves ſtung, looked up to it for cure. Thus is it with our <hi>Braſen Serpent,</hi> the <hi>Lord Jeſus.</hi> Others may look upon him, and yet be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the better for him: So did the <hi>Jews,</hi> who ſaw him crucified, yet had no benefit by him:<note place="margin">Ferus ad Text.</note> 
                        <hi>Multi viderunt &amp; oderunt, Many of them ſaw him, and hated him;</hi> and ſo had better never have ſeen him. Thus do many Chriſtians behold Chriſt in the hiſtory of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:169495:26"/> the Goſpel, behold him crucified before their eyes in the preaching of the word, and yet not feeling the neede they have of him, they ſhall never have any benefit by him.</p>
                     <p>O then labour wee firſt to be ſenſible of this, to feele our ſelves <hi>ſtung,</hi> mortally ſtung.<note place="margin">Be we ſenſible of our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> So we are, whether we feele it or no? and the leſſe we feele it, the greater is our dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the leſſe hope of grace: onely labour to bee thus ſenſible hereof, that ſo wee may feele the need wee have of Jeſus Chriſt, that wee may ſee our ſelves <hi>dead men</hi> without him. Now, and not till now, are we fit for him: Other qualifications or prediſpoſitions hee requireth none; onely that we be ſenſible of the need we have of him.

                  <p>See here how wonderfully the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi>
                     <note place="margin" type="runSum">A Generall Obſervation.</note> and other enemies of Chriſt who plotted his death, were diſappointed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in their intendments and expectations. Wherefore was it that they contrived this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill againſt him, to bring him to the Croſſe,<note place="margin">The Enemies of Chriſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed.</note> that ſhamefull and accurſed death? Why, this they did that they might thereby not onely take him out of the way, but withall render him odious and infamous unto the world; ſo as from thenceforth none ſhould ever look after him any more. This it was which gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and vexed the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees, viz.</hi> the ſucceſſe of his Miniſtery, that ſo many were taken with him, believed on him, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after him; and that notwithſtanding whatever they could do to the contrary. So much we may learn from their own mouthes in the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>verſe</hi> of this <hi>Chapter, The Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees ſaid among themſelves, Perceive ye how ye prevaile nothing? Behold the world is gone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him.</hi> Many there were who hearing of the great miracles which hee had wrought, (ſpecially that recorded in the fore going <hi>Chapter,</hi> the raiſing of <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the dead,) thereupon (as the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>verſe</hi> of this <hi>Chapter</hi> informes us) they flocked after him, and became his <hi>Diſciples.</hi> Now this, to the <hi>Phariſees</hi> (who could not endure that any ſhould be preferred before themſelves) it was no ſmall corroſive, it went to the heart of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:169495:69"/> them, they could not brook it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they plot againſt him. And (as it is the nature of <hi>envy,</hi> where once it is grown to an height) nothing will now content them but his <hi>blood.</hi> They reſolve never to leave till they had brought him to the Croſſe, taken him out of the way, hoping thereby to turne the ſtream of mens affections, either to deterre, or diſcourage any for ever looking after him more. This was their deſigne; but ſee how the ſucceſſe falls out clean contrary to their expectation. By this means Chriſt cometh to <hi>draw</hi> more then ever.

                     <note place="margin">Judg. 16.30.</note> then in his <hi>life.</hi> Thus the <hi>Son of man</hi> (of whom <hi>Samſon</hi> was a Type) he draweth more by, and after his death, then ever he did in his life; more, being <hi>lift up from the earth,</hi> then ever hee did being upon the earth.

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:169495:71"/> upon the face of Religion, caſting thoſe terms of infamy and reproach upon the good wayes of God, and thoſe that endeavour to walk cloſely in them; (I ſhall not need to name them, they are but too well known) all which are but as ſo many nails whereby they faſten the true Religion of Chriſt, the power of godlineſſe, to the Croſſe, wounding and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it through; that ſo having rendred it infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, they may deter or diſcourage any from looking that way which lieth under ſuch a cloud of reproach and diſgrace. But let not all this diſhearten: It was not the <hi>crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt</hi> in his <hi>Naturall body</hi> that could turne the eyes of men from looking towards him, or their hearts from beleeving on him: It is not the crucifying of Chriſt in his <hi>Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call body,</hi> the crucifying of his Religion, or the Profeſſours of it, that ſhall deter men from owning Chriſt and his waies. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of all ages hath made it good, that the malice, rage, and violence of the bittereſt and bloodieſt enemies of the Church, hath been but as bellowes to this fire, blowing up, ſpreading and diſperſing that Religion, that truth of God, which they have ſought and thought too have ſuppreſt and extinguiſhed.

Bloody Perſecutours have thought by their <hi>Dracoes Lawes,</hi> lawes written in Blood, and the ſevere execution thereof, utterly to have ſuppreſt the truth of the Goſpel, that none ſhould have dared to own it. But ſee how it hath fallen out contrary to their expectation, every <hi>Martyr</hi> proving like a <hi>Phoenix,</hi> out of whoſe aſhes not one, but many more have ſprung up. Thus Jeſus Chriſt where ever he hath been crucified in himſelf or members, ſtill he hath drawen many to himſelf. No fear therefore that by this means by, crucifying of Chriſt, the enemies of the Church ſhould prevail againſt it. Hereby they do but <hi>lift up Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that he may draw the more unto him, <hi>Quàm non ſint formidanda impio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum conſilia?</hi> (ſaith <hi>Muſculus</hi> upon it.)

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:169495:76"/> Croſſe in his paſſion, now henceforth hee draweth not onely <hi>Jews,</hi> but <hi>Gentiles;</hi> the Goſpel being from thenceforth to be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to both; and the Church to be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and made up out of both; according to what our Saviour had fore-told a little before, <hi>Cap.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>There ſhall be one Fold, and one Shepherd.</hi> And therefore ſaith he here, <hi>When I am lift up, I will draw all men unto me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of theſe two later acceptions it matters not which we imbrace. Or if you will, put them both together. Chriſt being lifted up, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to draw <hi>all men:</hi> that is, <hi>all his Elect</hi> people, being ſome of <hi>all ſorts</hi> and conditions of men. Such are the <hi>Elect</hi> of God, a ſele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted company, gathered out of all Nations, all ranks, ages, &amp;c. and ſo <hi>ſpecialis quadam univerſitas,</hi>

Now (alas,) againſt ſuch the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is too clear; They are not yet <hi>drawn,</hi> and brought home unto <hi>CHRIST.</hi>
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:169495:91"/> Chriſt never draws men <hi>blindfold</hi> to himſelf. But that he may draw them,<note place="margin">Acts 26.18.</note> he firſt <hi>opens their eyes.

Certainly, that ſoule that ſo imbraceth any one ſinfull luſt, as being convinced of the ſinfulneſſe of it, yet liveth and lieth in it, being reſolved not to part with it; it never yet knew what this effectuall work of Chriſt meant in drawing men to himfelfe.</p>

                  <p>Which as they are to do at all times, ſo ſpecially when their neceſſities call for it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any ſpeciall manner. Thus when <hi>Peter</hi> was in priſon, many of the Saints went to prayer for him, <hi>Act.</hi> 12.12.

                     <note place="margin">With one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</note>And as they are to pray one <hi>for</hi> another, ſo one <hi>with</hi> another; as in <hi>Publick</hi> (of which I have ſpoken already) ſo, as occaſion is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:169495:142"/> in <hi>private.</hi> Thus did <hi>Paul,</hi> being to take his leave of the <hi>Elders</hi> at <hi>Miletum,</hi> his laſt act was to pray with them: <hi>When he had thus ſpoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all,</hi> Acts 20.36. The like parting had he, and the Diſciples at <hi>Tyre,</hi> when they had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him to the ſea ſide, where he was to take ſhipping, they <hi>kneeled down on the ſhoar, and prayed,</hi> Acts 21.5. The like are Chriſtians to do as they have occaſion. And that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to get their <hi>Miniſters</hi> to pray with them, which occaſionally they are to do. It is Saint <hi>James</hi> his direction to <hi>ſick</hi> perſons, that as they ſhould pray for themſelves, (<hi>Is any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you afflicted, let him pray,</hi> Jam. 5.13.) ſo they ſhould ſend for the <hi>Elders of the Church,</hi> (the Miniſters) that they might <hi>pray over them,</hi> ver. 14. An office which <hi>Paul</hi> performed to the father of <hi>Publius;</hi> being ſick, <hi>Paul entered in, and prayed with him,</hi> Acts 28.8. And the <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpel</hi> are ſtill occaſionally to do the like, However they cannot <hi>lay hands on the ſick,</hi> and ſo <hi>heale</hi> them as <hi>Paul</hi> there did him, (that miraculous power, together with the ſigne of it, <hi>(Anointing)</hi> being now ceaſed, having been peculiar to thoſe primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times) yet they are to <hi>lift up their hands for them;</hi> which they are to do <hi>ex officio ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciali,</hi> as a duty belonging to them after a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner, by vertue of their office: but not onely to them. This are other <hi>private Chriſtians</hi> alſo to do <hi>ex officio charitatis,</hi> as an office of charity. So it there followeth in that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:169495:143"/> place of Saint <hi>James,</hi> ver. 16. <hi>Confeſſe your ſins one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may he healed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus have I briefly pointed at ſome amongſt many of thoſe <hi>reſpects</hi> and <hi>offices,</hi> which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians upon the account of their <hi>Joint-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip</hi> owe each to other.

Truly Chriſtians! ſhall you and I examine our ſelves for the time paſt, none of us but ſhall finde juſt cauſe of humbling for our failings in ſome, in many of theſe. In the ſenſe thereof, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging pardon for what is paſt, ſtir we up the grace of God for the future; that whileſt we performe duties of <hi>piety</hi> towards <hi>God,</hi> we may not be wanting in duties of <hi>charity</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our <hi>Brethren.</hi> Now conſider what I have ſaid, and the Lord give you underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in all things.</p>
